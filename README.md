### About

Please note that the project was created using the **Next.js** development environment. By launching the application, you will be directed to the main page of the site (**Home page**). The application includes a routing system, allowing you to navigate to the **Contact page** through the provided links.

On the Contact page, you will find two forms. The first form enables users to enter their First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, select appropriate options, and include an accompanying message. The second form allows users to subscribe to the Newsletter by submitting their email address.

Both forms may utilize **ZOD** for validation, which can be improved in future versions. The project also incorporates responsive design and utilizes **SCSS** for styling.
