# My Project

This project utilizes Git Flow for better project management and development.

## Git Flow

Git Flow is a branching model and development process that helps efficiently manage a project. By using Git Flow, we can work with various types of branches to organize development and prepare for releases effectively.

### Primary Git Flow Branch Types:

- **main**: The branch containing the stable version of the product.

- **pre-release**: The branch where active development takes place.

- **Features**: Branches created for developing new features. These branches are typically deleted after merging into the development branch.

### Creating Git Flow Branches:

- To create the development branch (develop): `git checkout -b pre-release`

- To create a feature branch (feature/feature-name): `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`

- To create a hotfix branch (hotfix/fix-name): `git checkout -b hotfix/fix-name`

### Example Branches I've Added:

- **Release Branch (pre-release)**: `pre-release`

### About

Please note that the project was created using the **Next.js** development environment. By launching the application, you will be directed to the main page of the site (**Home page**). The application includes a routing system, allowing you to navigate to the **Contact page** through the provided links.

On the Contact page, you will find two forms. The first form enables users to enter their First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, select appropriate options, and include an accompanying message. The second form allows users to subscribe to the Newsletter by submitting their email address.

Both forms may utilize **ZOD** for validation, which can be improved in future versions. The project also incorporates responsive design and utilizes **SCSS** for styling.
